## About Us

### Overview

Founded in 2014 by Richard Herveille, Roa Logic BV specialises in the development of Intellectual Property Cores for FPGA and ASIC, with a strong focus on the embedded market. We provide the IP required to build a complete embedded solution, including processors, peripherals, memory, and interfaces.

Roa Logic offers its IP for download from its [GitHub page](https://github.com/RoaLogic). All IP can be tested and used for non-commercial applications for free. For support, modifications, and commercial usage a fee charged. This business model allows our customers to test our IP and develop and test their application before making any financial commitments.

### Competency

Roa Logic expertise covers System, Hardware and Software development of FPGA and ASIC applications including:

  * 15+ Years of experience in FPGA and ASIC development, including Architecture specifications, RTL design, Verification, Synthesis, prototyping, test, debug.
  * 10+ Years of experience in programmable logic architecture design, including architecture specifications, software requirements, process & design flow specifications and implementation.

### Design Methodology

Roa Logic leverages technology independent HDL (Hardware Description Language) using a strict and robust top down design methodology. All IP is simulated at behavioral and gate levels and are provided with methodology scripts, exhaustive standard compliance verification suites and complete documentation.

### Products

Roa Logic's portfolio consists of RISC-V compliant embedded processors featuring AMBA Interfaces, associated peripherals & interfaces, bridging & switching and error correction cores
